[[spreadsheet.using]]
= Basic Use

[classname]#Spreadsheet# is a Vaadin component, which you can use as you would
any component. You can create it, or load from an Excel file, create cells and
new sheets, define formulas, and so forth. In the following, we go through these
basic steps.

[[spreadsheet.using.creating]]
== Creating a Spreadsheet

The default constructor for [classname]#Spreadsheet# creates an empty
spreadsheet with a default sheet. The spreadsheet component has full size by
default, so the containing layout must have defined size in both dimensions; a
spreadsheet may not have undefined size.

In the following example, we create an empty spreadsheet with a fixed size and
add it to a layout.


----
Spreadsheet sheet = new Spreadsheet();
sheet.setWidth("400px");
sheet.setHeight("300px");

layout.addComponent(sheet);
----

An empty spreadsheet automatically gets an initial worksheet with some default
size and settings.

[[spreadsheet.using.creating.loading]]
=== Loading an Excel Spreadsheet

You can load an Excel file from the local filesystem with a [classname]#File#
reference or from memory or other source with an [classname]#InputStream#.


[[spreadsheet.using.creating.poi]]
=== Working with an Apache POI Workbook

If you have an Apache POI workbook created otherwise, you can wrap it to
[classname]#Spreadsheet# with the respective constructor.

You can access the underlying workbook with [methodname]#getWorkbook()#.
However, if you make modifications to the workbook, you must allow the
spreadsheet update itself by calling appropriate update methods for the modified
element or elements.



[[spreadsheet.using.sheets]]
== Working with Sheets

A "spreadsheet" in reality works on a __workbook__, which contains one or more
__worksheets__. You can create new sheets and delete existing ones with
[methodname]#createNewSheet()# and [methodname]#deleteSheet()#, respectively.


----
// Recreate the initial sheet to configure it
Spreadsheet sheet = new Spreadsheet();
sheet.createNewSheet("New Sheet", 10, 5);
sheet.deleteSheet(0);
----

When a sheet is deleted, the index of the sheets with a higher index is
decremented by one. When the active worksheet is deleted, the next one by index
is set as active, or if there are none, the previous one.

All operations on the spreadsheet content are done through the currently active
worksheet. You can set an existing sheet as active with
[methodname]#setActiveSheetIndex()#.
